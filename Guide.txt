2. Polisch data

    2.1 service serviceStations
        2.1.1 convert all Polygons to positions
            ==> serviceStations-Nodes-Bordeaux-1.1.geojson
        2.1.2 deleate unessesary data
            ==> serviceStations-Nodes-Bordeaux-1.2.geojson
	    2.4.3 deleate unusable Service stations
	        ==> serviceStations-Nodes-Bordeaux-1.3.geojson

    2.2 street-Nodes
        2.2.1 merge near junction nodes (100m) into one
            ==> street-Nodes-Bordeaux-1.1.geojson
        

    2.3 generate a graph with the servicestation nodes and calculate the lenght 
        - find the neares street
        - recursiv in the right direction, add the lenght. If over 60km, break

    2.4 search if there is a not conected subgraph
        

    2.4 compute the shortes Path with Floyd-Warschal-Algorithm
        -
